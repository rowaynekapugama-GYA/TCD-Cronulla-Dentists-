# The Cronulla Dentists: push a new version to GitHub safely, from Terminal.
#
#   bash push-to-github.sh stage <zip or folder>   Put the new version on the `cms` branch.
#                                                  Vercel builds a PREVIEW. The live site is untouched.
#   bash push-to-github.sh promote                 Make the live site (`main`) exactly the `cms` branch.
#   bash push-to-github.sh rollback                Put `main` back to what it was before the last promote.
#   bash push-to-github.sh status                  Show what is on `main` and `cms` right now.
#
# It always works in a fresh copy of the repo in ~/gya-deploy, never in your Downloads folder, and it
# shows you what will change and asks before it pushes anything. `main` is only ever fast-forwarded to
# a commit Vercel has already built as a preview, so a push can never leave the live site half-updated.
#
# First run asks for the repo address (GitHub > the repo > green Code button > HTTPS) and remembers it.
# Works with macOS's built-in bash and git. Sign in to GitHub once with `gh auth login` (or GitHub
# Desktop) so git can push.
